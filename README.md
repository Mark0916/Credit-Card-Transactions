# Credit-Card-Transactions


Company XYZ is a major credit card company. It has information about all the transactions
that users make with their credit card.
Your boss asks you to do the following:

1. Your boss wants to identify those users that in your dataset never went above the
   monthly credit card limit. The goal of this is to automatically increase
   their limit. Can you send him the list of Ids?
2. On the other hand, she wants you to implement an algorithm that as soon as a user goes
   above her monthly limit, it triggers an alert so that the user can be notified about that.We
   assume here that at the beginning of the new month, user total money spent gets reset to zero.
   (i.e. she pays the card fully at the end of each month) Build a function that for
   each day, returns a list of users who went above their credit card monthly limit on that
   day.
3. Finally, your boss is very concerned about frauds cause they are a huge cost for credit
   card companies. She wants you to implement an unsupervised algorithm that returns all
   transactions that seem unusual and are worth being investigated further.
